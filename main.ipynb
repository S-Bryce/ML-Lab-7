    "The dataset is sourced from data.world on Kaggle, and is called \"Emotion Detection from Text\". It was distributed by data.world under a public license according to the source. The dataset is a collection of tweets annotated with emotions attached to each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist 3 columns, \"tweet_id\", \"sentiment\", and \"content\". Tweet_id represents the identification number of the tweet for querying with the Twitter API, sentiment is the classification of emotion associated with the content, and content is the raw text from the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 13 different emotions, with 40000 records. The dataset is imbalanced, as there are a different number of records per emotion, so this must be addressed in preprocessing the data.\n"

    "# Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Splitting the data\n",
    "We will be using Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation to split our data into training and testing sets. We chose this method based on the structure of our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains imbalanced classes, so we want to ensure that the distribution of the training & testing sets are representative of the overall distribution of classes in the dataset and is beneficial to reducing bias. Features like the sentiment feature are imbalanced with each of the 13 values associated with it having a different distribution across the dataset. Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation ensures this proportionality of distribution, unlike a normal train test split which randomly splits the data into two sets based on a predefined ratio. This can result in a skewed representation of classes in the training & testing datasets not representative of the distribution of the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation also gives us the advantage of being able to compare different models as each model is trained differently per fold. This will help us in hyper parameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tokenization methods, Vocabulary, and content length\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Keras Tokenizer class to tokenize the text data in our dataset. We convert each tweet's text into a sequence of integers, where each integer represents a unique word in the vocabulary. The Tokenizer also takes care of lowercasing, removing punctuation, and handling out-of-vocabulary words.\n",
    "\n",
    "We defined our vocabulary to use all the unique words in \"content\", this was because we didn't want to lose any data as we thought this would also generalize our model better overall. Although this will increase the complexity of our model, and one could also argue that mispellings and grammatical errors can lead to an incorrect classification; we believe that grammatical errors and slang are common ways of emotional expression online. For example, if a user tweets GAAAAAHHHH, that probably means they're very upset versus someone who tweets GAH which may indicate surprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to keep the length of each sequence to the longest individual sequence by using padding, as this'll help us capture the maximum amount of input for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluation, we decided to rely on the F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy. This is because we are performing a classification task on sequences to predict sentiment. Precision is important because it helps us guage the our models True positive predictiveness, and recall helps us identify the number of positive instances correctly identified out of the total amount of positive cases. In our specific case, recall is important because it'll tell us the ratio of how much our classifier was able to identify correct sentiment, like happiness, out the all of the happiness records. Precision will tell us if our evaluation of sentiment was correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 score balances both of these metrics together, and provides a balanced measure of our models performance. In sentiment analysis, false positives and false negatives are not good because both types of errors can have significant consequences, especially in a system which relies on the classification to provide recommendations or critical information. A high F1-score indicates that our model is making accurate positive predictions while minimizing false positives and false negatives. It is also useful in our case as well since our dataset is imbalanced, because it reduces bias to the majority class by giving a balanced result of the recall and precision to account for both false positives and false negatives."
